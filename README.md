# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Notes:

First dive into React, my goal is to create a fully functional React Tic Tac Toe App. I will be using the offical [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial) to create this.

## How to run this project:

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
<br><br>
Navigate into the project directory, <strong>which is ljg0t8</strong>
<br><br>
Run <strong>`npm install`</strong> to download all dependencies and packages required for running the application locally.
<br><br>
Finally, Run <strong>`npm start`</strong> to start a local server.
